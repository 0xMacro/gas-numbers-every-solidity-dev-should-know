To run this repo locally, run `npm run dev` and then open index.html in your browser. I prefer to do so with VS Code's live server extension.

This repo uses Browserify / Watchify to keep the simplicity of html & vanilla js webpages, preserving the developer comforts of node, and creating an optimized production bundle.
